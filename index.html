            <h3>Software Quality Assurance Engineer</h3>
            <p>I have been working as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer in a multinational company. I love my job as
                it
                gives me the opportunity to learn new techonology and improve the product quality. I belive QA-ing is
                not
                only about finding bugs, its about overall contribution to improve the product quality itself. I want to
                push the boundary of QA-ing by acquiring new skillsets.</p>
